# 1. Variables and Data Types:
# Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare variable types.
# Common data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and booleans.

# Integers
an_int = 10

# Floats
a_float = 3.14

# Strings
message = "Hello, Python!"

# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

# Booleans
is_true = True
is_false = False

# 2. Control Structures:
# Python provides various control structures like if statements, loops (for and while), and conditional expressions.

# If statement
if num1 > num2:
    print("num1 is greater than num2")
elif num1 == num2:
    print("num1 is equal to num2")
else:
    print("num1 is less than num2")

# For loop
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# 3. Functions:
# Functions in Python allow you to encapsulate code for reuse.

# Here's an example of defining and calling a function:
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
